📌 Project Overview

The Advanced Ride Sharing Management System is a console-based application developed in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) principles.

This project simulates a real-world ride booking platform (similar to Uber/Ola) where customers can book rides, drivers can manage availability, and administrators can monitor system activity.

The system is designed with modular architecture, authentication mechanisms, driver allocation logic, dynamic fare calculation, and persistent ride history storage
